Running Simulations in OpenMM
=============================
To run simulations with the models presented in our paper, you need to 
install the OpenMM molecular simulation software. Once that is done
you can use the inputs here to try and reproduce the simulations.

Before doing so, you need to generate a force field file in the 
PotentialFit directory and copy it here. Then, please run

```
./run_one_simulation.py -h
```
please check the output and the script itself.
